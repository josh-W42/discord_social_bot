# Discord Social Bot

### Description:

This is a node.js project that houses a social media discord bot.

The idea was a discord bot that would post to a specific discord channel whenever a new youtube video was posted from a specific channel.

The current use case is to keep a content creator's community engaged with the content they create on various social media without having to post the content manually.

There's a lot of other tools/bots out there that do this with more features but I wanted to try it myself and self-host it on a raspberry-pi for free.

### Opportunities for expansion:

- Tracking other social media accounts: Twitter (X), instagram, etc...
- Provide an front-end interface to modify parameters (which youtube channel to track..., what discord channel to post in... etc).
